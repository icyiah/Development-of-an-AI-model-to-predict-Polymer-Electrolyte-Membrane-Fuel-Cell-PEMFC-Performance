# Machine Learning
This folder contains all the MATLAB files used to train machine learning models (regression models)

## Brief description of code
1. **RLApp**: File used to format data to be used for Regression Learner App
2. **resultsTable .csv**: csv files containing results for test set and combined sets
3. **sess .mat**: Saved sessions for regression learner app

Remaining files are helper functions and data files

## Instructions
1. Run RLApp script to obtain dataset in MATLAB workspace
2. Open regression learner app and use datasets in workspace to train and test machine learning models
3. Open sess .mat files in regression learner app to view previously saved sessions
