# Data Preprocessing
This folder contains all the MATLAB files used for Data Preprocessing. 

## Brief description of code
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data visualisation and data preprocessing files (includes parallel plots, PCA, F-Tests, mRMR and RReliefF etc)
2. **Obtain CSV Files**: Files used to split data into 70:15:15 ratio to use for training
3. **ML**: Machine learning files (using Regression Learner App)
4. **Shallow Pressure and Shallow Temperature**: Training of shallow NN for pressure and temperature targets respectively
5. **Projects**: Training of deep NN for pressure and temperature targets (using Experiment Manager App).
6. **Input Optimisation**: Input optimisation files (using baysopt, interior point, random and grid search)
7. **NN from scratch**: Creating NN from scratch to compare with MATLAB ```train()``` function
8. **Final Report Appendix**: Files included in final report appendix
