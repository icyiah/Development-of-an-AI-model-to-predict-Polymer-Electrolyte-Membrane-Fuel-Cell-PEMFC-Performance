# App
This folder contains all the MATLAB files used to implement an app designed to enable users to find the optimal PEMFC parameters

## Brief description of code
1. **App_v2.mlapp**: Code used to create app
2. **Channel_Dimensions.csv**: csv file containing exported channel dimensions (this can be imported into a fusion 360 to adjust the size of a CAD model of a PEMFC)

Remaining files are images and data files

## Instructions
1. Open App_v2.mlapp and click **run** to run the optimisation and **export** to export the results.
