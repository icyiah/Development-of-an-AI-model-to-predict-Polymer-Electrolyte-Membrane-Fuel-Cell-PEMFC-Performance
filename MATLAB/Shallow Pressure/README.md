# Shallow Pressure
This folder contains all the MATLAB files used to implement shallow NN for pressure target

## Brief description of code
1. **use_bayesopt.mlx**: Run Bayesian optimisation together with the ```train()``` function to obtain the best model
2. **Evaluate_Best_Model.mlx**: Show the training history and true vs pred plots of a model

Remaining files are data files

## Instructions
1. Open use_bayesopt.mlx and run as a live script to start a new trial
2. To view previous trial, load bayesopt_trial_1.mat into the workspace
## To view the results of a model
1. Open Evaluate_Best_Model.mlx and run as a live script to view model results
