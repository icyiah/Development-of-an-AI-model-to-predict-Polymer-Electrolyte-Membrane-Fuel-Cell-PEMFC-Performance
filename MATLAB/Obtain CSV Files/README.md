# Obtain CSV Files
This folder contains all the MATLAB files used to 

## Brief description of code
1. **Obtain_All_CSV**: File used to shuffle seen and unseen dataset before splitting the data into a 70:15:15 ratio for training. All datasets are stored as CSV files.
2. **resultsTable .csv**: csv files containing results for test set and combined sets
3. **sess .mat**: Saved sessions for regression learner app

Remaining files are helper functions and data files

## Instructions
1. Run RLApp script to obtain dataset in MATLAB workspace
2. Open regression learner app and use datasets in workspace to train and test machine learning models
3. Open sess .mat files in regression learner app to view previously saved sessions
