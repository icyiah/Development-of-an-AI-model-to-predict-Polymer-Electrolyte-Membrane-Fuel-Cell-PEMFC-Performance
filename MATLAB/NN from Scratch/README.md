# NN from scratch
This folder contains all the MATLAB files used to compare a manually created NN with a NN created using the ```train()``` function

## Brief description of code
1. **Manual_vs_MATLAB_NN**: Trains two NNs to solve for an XOR problem. One NN is trained manually and another with the ```train()``` function. The code then compares the results as well as the weights and biases before and after training.
