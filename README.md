# Development of an AI model to predict Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell PEMFC Performance

A Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is an electrochemical device which directly converts
the chemical energy found in hydrogen into electricity, also known as a hydrogen fuel cell.
This project focuses on the S-8 Duralite Power Fuel Cell Stack, with consideration
of design parameters like channel dimensions and operating parameters such as ambient temperature,
heat generation, and input air velocity.

This repository contains code used to to develop optimised AI models that predict the pressure drop 
and temperature of the PEMFC stack given as set of input parameters. It also includes code that is able 
to quantify physical parameters that result in the lowest PEMFC pressure drop while allowing the PEMFC 
to operate within the optimal temperature range of 55 to 60 Â°C.

## Implementation is done on:

1. **MATLAB**: MATLAB R2023b

2. **Python**: Python with TensorFlow and Keras API

Refer to respective README.md for further instructions.
